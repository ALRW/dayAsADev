Section 8 - Adding our own style
================================

So what is Bootstrap providing for us under the scenes? So far we've written a little Ruby (telling our computer what to do), a little HTML (decribing the structure of the content we want for our page) and now we come to CSS.

CSS (more formally Cascading Style Sheets) is the technology we use to define the *layout* and *design* of the HTML *structure* we have already written. Without CSS our webpages would just be a load of left-justified, black-text-on-white-backgorund monstrosities.

Bootstrap will take us a long way
