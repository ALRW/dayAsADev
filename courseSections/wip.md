As a prototypical user
I would like to be able to contact the owners of a prototypical site
In order to ask them questions about their prototypes
```

And for the second user story add the following below that:

```html
<div class="contact hidden">
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>

  <strong>Via snailmail</strong>
  <address>
    Prototype, Inc.<br>
    1 Prototype Tower <br>
    London <br>
    PO00PP
  </address>

  <strong>Via the interwebs</strong><br>
  <a href="mailto:#>example@example.com</a>

</div>
```
