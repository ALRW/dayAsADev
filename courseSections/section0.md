What do I do if I get stuck
---------------------------

One of the first problems to overcome as a developer is getting stuck. It's a tricky one because getting stuck sucks especially when you have no idea how to get unstuck. The good news is that all developers have been there so the following guidelines provide a handrail to follow throughout the day when you face a problem and can't seem to find a way out.

1. Try to work out what is actually going on. It sounds patronising but if you can describe the problem you at least know what is blocking you. Even if it is in vague terms if you then need to seek help you can at the very least describe the problem accurately.
2. Talk everything through with your pair partner, bounce ideas off each other. Take a quick break and then approach the problem again as though it is the first time you have encountered it.
3. Throughout the proceeding steps try to gather keywords that relate to the problem like, 'Array' or 'Terminal'.
4. Isolate error keywords. If you have an error message, identify and add these keywords to your results from (3).
5. Google! Research the problem using your keywords. Also use the keywords to indentify relevant results (i.e. not just the first one).
6. Other pairs of Developers. Take your well-described, well formatted question to another developer or pair of developers; they may have encountered the same problem and know how to solve it.
7. Coach/Senior Developer. If all else fails take your question all the way to the top. Don't be disappointed though if the answer comes as more questions.

One question that often gets asked in this situation is: "How long should I wait before asking for help?" As a general rule when you hit a problem try your utmost to struggle with it for 15 minutes. Any less time and you're not really trying, much longer and you start to waste your own time and slow down development.
