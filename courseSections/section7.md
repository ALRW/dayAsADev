Section 7 - A Prototype Website
==============================

You've come a long way so far today. Now that we've accumulated a large amount of building-block knowledge lets put it to use and actually build ourselves a prototype website. 

A bit of role-play: lets picture a scene. A potential client has expressed interest in revamping their business website but to see what we are capable of they have asked us to produce a prototype for their prototype business. Kindly they have also provided us with a few user stories and a number of wireframes to work with. Fantastic.

To start with 

```
As a prototypical user 
I would like a navigation bar
In order to navigate around a prototype website
```

```
As a detail oriented prototypical user
I would like to see a descriptive home page
In order to understand what a prototype website is for
```

And a helpful first wireframe.
