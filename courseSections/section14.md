==========================
[Go to course navigation](../navigation.md)

That's it for the day, congratulations. Have a think about what you've accomplished. In the course of a day you've built an application's backend in **Ruby**; created content in **HTML**; styled that content using **CSS**; added a dynamic frontend using **JavaScript** and deployed the resulting prototype to a production environment that can be accessed by anyone anywhere in the world. Not bad for a day's work.

More importantly, throughout this journey you've also touched almost every aspect of web-development from Git and version control systems to interpreted and compiled languages. Hopefully you now feel in a position to understand any discombobulated phrase that a developer throws your way.

As with every piece of learning and development things shouldn't stop at the end of the course. This is a starting point not the finish line. So to help you on your way the following are a few 100% free resources that can help you build upon everything you've picked up here today.

Further learning and development
-------------------------------

While there are numerous articles, blogs, books, courses and other resources out there today many are of questionable quality or are prohibitively costly. The following resources are in contrast, high quality and more importantly all offer free material (some charge for additional content).

-------------------------------

[Learn to Program - PDF](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) 

A great book to cover the basics of programming by Chris Pine. Focuses on the Ruby language but everything covered is highly applicable across all programming languages.

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

A platform for learning to code with numerous short courses for various languages and web technologies. It is a great place to start your learning about a particular language.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

Some good basic and intermediate courses on web development that focus primarily on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

Although it has a freemium model and some low quality content there is a wealth of fantastic resources that can be accessed here.

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

A platform for computer science, web developement and machine learning/AI courses. Offers more in depth nano-degrees although after a free trial these can become expensive.

[Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)

A fantastic and completely free programming resource based on a HTML CSS and JavaScript stack. Great if you want to dive in, go all the way and not pay a penny.

[Exercism](http://exercism.io/)

Code kata are a proven way of improving your ability to program by facing short interesting problems. It's also a nice way to experiment with a new language. Exercism is probably the best platform to do this through and the feedback and iterative approach it provides is second to none.

[CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/)

Another good code-kata website that has a massive number of challenges.
