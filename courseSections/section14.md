That's it for the day, congratulations. have a think about what you've accomplished. In the course of a day you've built an application's backend in **Ruby**; created content to display in **HTML**; styled that content using **CSS**; added a dynamic frontend using **JavaScript** and deployed the resulting prototype to a production environment that can be accessed by anyone anywhere in the world. Not bad for a day's work. 

More importantly, throughout this journey you've also touched almost every aspect of web-development from Git and version control systems to interpreted and compiled languages and hopefully you now feel in a position to understand any discombobulated phrase that a developer throws your way.

As with every piece of learning and development things shouldn't stop at the end of the course. This is a starting point not the finish line. So to help you on your way the following are a few 100% free resources that can help you build upon everything you've picked up here today.
