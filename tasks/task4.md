Task 4 - Styling the page.
==========================

This should be a relatively simple one and we should just be able to re-use some of the styling we created for our `.jumbotron`.

Styling the `.navbar` element with following:

```css
.navbar {
  border: solid 2px #0E1C36;
  background-color: #AFCBFF;
}
```

should hopefully leave you with something similar to the screenshot below:
