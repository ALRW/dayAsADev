Task 2 - Answers
===============

Once you have added something like `I want to learn how to be more like [insert name] awesome developer that I know` to your readme and saved it then running 

``` 
$ git status
```

should show you that there are changes to your `README.md` file. Add this

```
$ git add README.md
```

and then commit it.

```
$ git commit -m "Updated the readme with my motivation to learn"
```

then push

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

by following these steps your code should now be up on Github.

:twisted_rightwards_arrows: You should now switch over and on the new driver's laptop pull down the changes by running:

```
$ git pull origin master
``` 

Double check: if you open `README.md` do you see the changes that are held on github? 

Congratulations you now have all the basics of version control.

For the rest of this course whenever you see the :twisted_rightwards_arrows: you should add, commit and push your code so that your pair partner can pull down your changes and work away on their own laptop. Consider bookmarking this page for quick reference.

Otherwise if everything is good lets get building!
