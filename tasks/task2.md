Task 2 - Answers
===============

Once you have added something like `I want to learn how to be more like [insert name] awesome developer that I know` to your readme and saved it running 

``` 
$ git status
```

should show you that there are changes to your `README.md` file. Add this

```
$ git add README.md
```

and then commit it.

```
$ git commit -m "Updated the readme with my motivation to learn"
```

then push

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

should have your code up on github

Now on your pairs other laptop running

```
$ git pull origin master
``` 

should pull down the chagnes that have been made to the `README.md` - very cool!

For the rest of this course whenever you see the :twisted_rightwards_arrows: you should add, commit and push your code so that your pair partner can pull down your changes and work away on their own laptop. Consider bookmarking this page for quick reference.

Otherwise if everything is good lets get building!
