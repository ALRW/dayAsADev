A day as a Developer
====================

What is this all about?
----------------------

As a Business Analyst working in tech you have the fortune/misfortune to work with developers. At time this group of colleagues might be found huddling together making obscure jokes about data-structure, the speed of their algorithm or the latest xkcd such [as](https://xkcd.com/754/)

The truth is that being a web developer requires a braod range of skills and the willingness to dive into something that you know almost nothing about, learn it, use that knowledge to fix your current problem and then find another problem and do it all again. It is about leveraging a large range of skills, technologies and languages putting them all together and making things that work, even when it is particularly bewildering.

And that what this project is for: to take you out of your day to day role as a Business Analyst and give you a peek under the hood and maybe challenge you to get a bit out of your depth.

Lets begin!

How to follow this Course
------------------------

Nothing in the course is designed as a trap. If you follow through you should end the day with a working Minimum Viable Product website that can be deployed for the rest of the world to see! There are only two rules:

 - **Type every line of code yourself.** While it can seem faster to copy and paster it stops your from learning what is going on. 
 - **Your don't need to understand everything.** Understanding is vital but so is managing how much you need to know - there is only so much time in the day and we want to have a working website at the end of this particular day. It isn't possible to understand everything.

What do I do if I get stuck
---------------------------

One of the first problems to overcome as a developer is getting stuck. It's a tricky one because getting stuck sucks especially when you have no idea how to get unstuck. The good news is that all developers have been there so the following guidelines provide a handrail to follow throughout the day when you face a problem and can't seem to find a way out.

1. Try to work out what is actually going on. It sounds patronising but if you can describe the problem you at least know what is blocking you. Even if it is in vague terms if you then need to seek help you can at the very least describe the problem accurately.
2. Talk everything through with your pair partner, bounce ideas off each other. Take a quick break and then approach the problem again as though it is the first time you have encountered it.
3. Throughout the proceeding steps try to gather keywords that relate to the problem like, 'Array' or 'Terminal'.
4. Isolate error keywords. If you have an error message, identify and add these keywords to your results from (3).
5. Google! Research the problem using your keywords. Also use the keywords to indentify relevant results (i.e. not just the first one).
6. Other pairs of Developers. Take your well-described, well formatted question to another developer or pair of developers; they may have encountered the same problem and know how to solve it.
7. Coach/Senior Developer. If all else fails take your question all the way to the top. Don't be disappointed though if the answer comes as more questions.

One question that often gets asked in this situation is: "How long should I wait before asking for help?" As a general rule when you hit a problem try your utmost to struggle with it for 15 minutes. Any less time and you're not really trying, much longer and you start to waste your own time and slow down development.

 This leads us nicely onto [Section 0](./courseSections/section0.md).
