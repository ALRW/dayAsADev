A day as a Developer
====================

What is this all about?
----------------------

As a Business Analyst working in tech you have the fortune/misfortune to work with developers. At time this group of colleagues might be found huddling together making obscure jokes about data-structure, the speed of their algorithm or the latest xkcd such [as](https://xkcd.com/754/)

The truth is that being a web developer requires a braod range of skills and the willingness to dive into something that you know almost nothing about, learn it, use that knowledge to fix your current problem and then find another problem and do it all again. It is about leveraging a large range of skills, technologies and languages putting them all together and making things that work, even when it is particularly bewildering.

And that what this project is for: to take you out of your day to day role as a Business Analyst and give you a peek under the hood and maybe challenge you to get a bit out of your depth.

Lets begin!

How to follow this Course
------------------------

Nothing in the course is designed as a trap. If you follow through you should end the day with a working Minimum Viable Product website that can be deployed for the rest of the world to see! There are only two rules:

 - **Type every line of code yourself.** While it can seem faster to copy and paster it stops your from learning what is going on. 
 - **Your don't need to understand everything.** Understanding is vital but so is managing how much you need to know - there is only so much time in the day and we want to have a working website at the end of this particular day. It isn't possible to understand everything.

 This leads us nicely onto [Section 0](./courseSections/section0.md).
