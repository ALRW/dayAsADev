This course is heavily based on the [Build a Website](https://github.com/makersacademy/build-a-website) project and uses a similar style of teaching to that propagated by the phenomenal [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). If you don't know anything about Makers then do take a look it is an awesome organisation.
