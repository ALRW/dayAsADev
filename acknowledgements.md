This course is heavily based on the [Build a Website :link:](https://github.com/makersacademy/build-a-website) project and uses a similar style of teaching to that propagated by the phenomenal [Makers Academy :link:](http://www.makersacademy.com/). If you don't know anything about Makers then do take a look it is an awesome organisation.

The logo for the prototype website was made by [Freepik :link:](http://www.freepik.com) and was made available through [www.flaticon.com :link:](http://www.flaticon.com) - a great resource
